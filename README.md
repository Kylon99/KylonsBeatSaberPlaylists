# KylonsBeatSaberPlaylists
A repo for storing and updating Kylon's favorite Beat Saber playlists!  Most songs in these lists are for dancing and the maps need to be done well: they must be in time and promote dancing by not spamming notes.  If you know of any well mapped songs that can be added to the list let me know!

## Installation
Simply copy all the playlist files to Beat Saber\Playlists

## The 80's
* Let's go back to the 80's!  Michael Jackson, Back to the Future, The Transformers!  This playlist contains only the well mapped songs from the 80's or early 90's.

This list mostly consists of well mapped American pop songs from the 80's plus any 80's meme songs.  There are some very danceable maps but there are also slower songs that are for chilling too.  This is mostly a nostalgia trip.

## Golden Oldies
* Classic Rock and others from the 60's and 70's, now in Beat Saber!

This list is for Classic Rock from the 60's and 70's, and other styles such as Disco will be in the other playlist.  This music is before my time but I remember them all thanks to my local comic book store always having it on when I went.

## All That Jazz
* Danceable Jazz and Swing in Beat Saber from all eras but mostly inspired by the 1930's and 1940's!

This playlist will have danceable Jazz from any era.  Modern Jazz and Swing is also acceptable, the most important thing is that the song is mapped well and encourages quick tempo dancing!

## Saturday Night Saber
* Let's all go to the disco and Beat Saber!  All disco-like songs from any era!

This playlist is for disco songs from the 70's or any very heavy disco inspired song from other eras.  All the songs here must be danceable and well mapped and make you want to hit the dance floor in a bell bottomed leisure suit!
